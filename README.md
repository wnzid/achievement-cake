# Achievement Cake

**Achievement Cake** is a desktop application that turns achievements into something visual, shared, and meaningful inspired by the recent *achievement cake* trend.

Instead of tracking progress with numbers or streaks, achievements are represented as **toothpicks placed on a cake**, making progress feel celebratory, intentional, and human.

## Why this project exists

This project started as something personal.

I originally built **Achievement Cake** for my girlfriend as a way to celebrate **our achievements together**, even while being physically apart. It helped turn individual efforts into something shared, visible, and emotionally meaningful.

The idea comes from the **achievement cake trend**, where accomplishments are marked on a cake rather than logged traditionally. I wanted to turn that idea into a **real, usable application** - one that supports connection, not pressure.

Now, it’s published so that **other long-distance couples** (and anyone who wants to celebrate progress together) can use it too.
